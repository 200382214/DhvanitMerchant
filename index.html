<h3>Two Paragraphs About Me</h3>
<p class="s1">
        
<i>

        
        My name is Dhvanit, aged 17, 18 this year. Born in the great country of India,<br>
        I enjoy music a lot but I tend to be band oriented thus becoming a self-proclaimed band geek.<br>
        I am very smart working guy and hard working too.I like to work for the company which can understand <br>
        my talents and especially tells me my hidden talents so that I can do my best for raising your compant in 
        high level.<br>
</p>
<p>
    I'm a good listener. I like to help other people, though sometimes it kind of overtakes my own problems. <br>
    I'll admit right now that I work on other people's problems to get away from my own. I've been told I'm good with advice, <br>I just never seem to be able to help myself.
    My MAIN AIM is to help my customers and treat everyone as a nice person.</p>
